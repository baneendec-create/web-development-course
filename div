                        <p> The disadvantages of fog computing center on its increased complexity, security vulnerabilities (like MitM attacks on more nodes), higher setup/management costs, potential for congestion, difficult scalability compared to the cloud, data consistency challenges, and higher power consumption due to the added infrastructure layer</p>

                        <h2> HOW TO AVIOD IT</h2>
                        <p> style=To avoid fog, especially on car windows, you need to reduce moisture and balance air temperatures, using your car's defroster (AC + fresh air), cracking windows, and keeping glass clean; for other items like glasses or goggles, creating a barrier with soap, anti-fog sprays, or proper fit works best. For "brain fog," focus on sleep, diet, exercise, and stress management. </p>

<h3> The most relatable things</h3> <p>Sensory Details: Focus on what you can see (or can't see), hear, and feel – the dampness, the hushed sounds, the blurry outlines of buildings or trees.
Atmosphere: Use words like "eerie," "mysterious," "somber," "hazy," or "silent" to set the mood.
Metaphors: Compare fog to a blanket, a screen, or even a cat, as in Carl Sandburg's poem "Fog" that notes its silent, cat-like approach.
Progression: A paragraph can describe the fog rolling in, its peak density, or its gradual disappearance, revealing the world anew as sunlight breaks through. </p> <img src="download.jfif"> <img src="download (1).jfif">
